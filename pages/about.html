    <h1>About BodingCat</h1>

    <p>
      To introduce my client, his name is Alexander Lipatov. The problem that he
      faced was that, after completing his AP CSA and AP CSP courses, he felt
      that CodingBat was no longer as useful to him anymore. This was because he
      became largely proficient in both Python and Java, the only two languages
      that CodingBat offers questions on. As a result, when I arrived to him
      with the idea of recreating CodingBat such that it had an expanded
      curriculum that also taught other languages, he readily agreed to
      supporting the project. As his requirements, he stated the following
      criteria:
    </p>

    <p>The new website is visually appealing.</p>
    <p>The new website provides proper HTML questions.</p>
    <p>The new website gives the user more aid in solving the problems.</p>

    <br />

    <p>
      My program is a parody of the CodingBat website, aptly named BodingCat.
      The program is designed to provide the user with three main types of
      exercises, those being categorized as HTML questions, CSS questions, and
      JavaScript questions. For each category, there is an accompanying webpage
      that provides 5 exercises each. The amount is small due to this
      presentation being mostly a demonstration and time constraints, but the
      program is built to accommodate the inclusion of more questions. Each
      question is listed off in a table at the top of each page and the user
      must choose which question they are to complete through the use of a
      drop-down menu. Both the table and the drop-down menus are generated
      through two respective functions. This is possible because all of the
      questions for each category are written in an array of arrays where each
      question is one array and bears objects that are used to store the
      question’s name, description, and solution. The JavaScript questions
      include an additional object that defines the test cases. It should also
      be noted that these questions were generated through AI, which is cited in
      the code and in the citations page. Anyways, through this, the functions
      iterate through the array, collecting each question’s position in the
      array, name, and, in the case of the table, the question’s description and
      display in the respective table and menu. A similar process and function
      exists to display the name and description of the question once it is
      selected by the user in the drop-down menu.

    </p>
    <p>
      In the JavaScript category, there is no iframe. Rather, there are three
      test cases that the user must correctly respond to. The responses in this
      are more helpful to the user, as they specify what the user did
      incorrectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, there is no hint system in the program. Instead, the option
      to view the code’s solution always exists right next to the run code
      button through the ‘show solution’ button. By clicking on the button, the
      default solution is pasted into the textarea, allowing the user to also
      run the code and alter it as they like or see what specifically they did
      wrong. It also acts as a way of showing the different ways to achieve the
      same programming goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the 3 question categories and the main page, there are also two
      additional web pages that the user may browse. The first is the Citations
      page, which is split in two. The left half lists off a table of resources
      that the program’s creator used to a significant extent in writing the
      program. On the other side, the right half lists off the three people
      mainly responsible for the program’s creation. These are the creator, the
      client, and the creator’s advisor during the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, the about page details generic information about the program
      itself, mainly the documentation.

      The first main challenge that I faced after I decided on making this
      project was the most monumental one, which was I had never used HTML
      before and didn’t even know what it looked like. It might seem a bit off
      that I would opt to create my final project in a language I didn’t even
      know, but, regrettably, I decided that, since I didn’t know how to write
      HTML, I would learn it. Mainly, I watched some youtube videos and checked
      in with W3Schools, Mozilla, and StackOverflow whenever I had an idea and
      didn’t know if it was possible in HTML. I also asked for help from my
      friend Brian, who was extremely adept at the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that hurdle, I struggled to make the core of my program, which was
      the actual code storing and compiling process itself. I spent a lot of
      time consulting with the aforementioned sources, initially attempting to
      use an input box to receive the code and trying to create a separate
      webpage to display the user’s code. Thankfully, before I went through with
      that, I discovered that iframe and text areas were readily available to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was making my compiler program, I checked in with my client to
      show him my progress. I assured him that the compiler was on the way, but
      the first thing he commented on was how the web page looked. It was as
      barebones as CodingBat, and looked extremely disorganized, too, which went
      against the initial criteria he had for the project. At the same time, I
      showed Brian my work and he commented the same thing. To help, he showed
      me the catppuccin website and its available color palettes. I took both of
      their critiques to heart, returning with a more visually appealing design
      that used soft blue colors and varied text rather than the default
      settings. I also incorporated a proper icon and logo image for my program.
      As a result, both my client and Brian were satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last major challenge that I faced was in figuring out how to compile
      the JavaScript code. My original idea was to have the user type out the
      whole HTML code like I did with teh HTML and CSS categories, but Brian
      redirected me towards using try…catch, eval, and push instead since that
      would only require the user to type the function instead. I browsed a lot
      through the Mozilla pages he sent me and had to do a lot of
      troubleshooting, but I managed to get it to work in the end somehow.

      The user should download the program. If github doesn’t have the files in
      their respective folders, I attached a google drive. After getting the
      file in the right form, open the index file and work from there. Pick any
      of the categories, answer the questions as best as possible, compare your
      answers with the default solution, and move on to another one when done.
      Then, the user is free to do whatever they feel like, whether it be
      closing the program or browsing through the pages.
